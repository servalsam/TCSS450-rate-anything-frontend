# RateAnything is a mobile Android application which allows users to give ratings to products, businesses, places, activities, and more. RateAnything helps people make judgments on public offerings by displaying reviews made by other users on each item. Categories help users filter through varying interests and display items with ratings pertaining to those categories. RateAnything provides the user with the ability to tag items with category headers and other sub-headers which provides the default way of showing categorical data. Users are able to attach descriptive data and their review response on each item uniquely, which then can be seen publicly on the item. The goal of RateAnything is to provide a unified area of feedback.

# User Stories

# 2.0 (High) As a user, I need to be able to submit details about an item, because it will give specific information on an item that can be reviewed.
# 3.0 (High) As a user, I need to be able to submit a rating on an item, so that the quality of an item can be assessed.
# 4.0 (High) As a user, I need to be able to view other users’ ratings and reviews, because I want a user-reflected assessment of an item before I make decisions on it.
# 5.0 (Medium) As a user, I want the ability to login to rate items, add categories, and add items, because I want my reviews to be secure or verified.
# 6.0 (Medium) As a user, I should be able to see my item entry history, because I want to view what I previously rated if I need to change, update, or delete an entry.
# 7.0 (Medium) As a user, I want to view ratings without authentication, as I would want access to the app’s primary functionality without logging in for quick searches.
# 8.0 (Medium) As a user, I should be able to edit the item if I am the item’s creator, because my item’s description or status might change over time.

# 11.0 (Low) As a user, I want to be able to search for tags across all categories, because my search might not reflect in the category I’m currently searching in.
# 12.0 (Low) As a user, I want to directly share my review with another user, because I want to share the item with a user that would be interested in the item. 
# 13.0 (Low) As a user, I want to customize the tags within categories and items, so that an item may be easily searchable and make its description easier to consume.
# 14.0 (Low) As a user, I want to be able to rate items at a specific place, so that review reflects the whole experience of the item.
# 15.0 (Low) As a user, I should have the ability to add additional categories, because my item may not exist in a current category or not defined accurately by current categories.
